title: Machine Learning and Data Analysis - Week4 | K-Means
published: true
---

This is the fourth assignment of the fourth course (of five)
[Data Analysis and Interpretation Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis)
detailed information about it can be seeing [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis).

See the entire code and output for this week,  [here](https://github.com/Sidon/Sidon.github.io/blob/master/_posts/kmeans.ipynb).

This assignment deals with k-means cluster "Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning method that partitions the observations in a data set into a smaller set of clusters where each observation belongs to only one cluster. The goal of cluster analysis is to group, or cluster, observations into subsets based on their similarity of responses on multiple variables."

Details of my project can be seeing
[here](https://sidon.github.io/data-visualization-week1/), For this assignment,
I add 10 variables, to get easier, I made a summary bellow:

|Variable Name|Description|Type       |Kind|
|-------------|-----------|:---------:|:--:|
|Income       |GPD per capita |C|E|
|Alcohol      |Alcohol Consumption |C|E|
|Army         |Armed force rate|Q|E|
|bCancer      |Breast Cancer rate|Q|E|
|CO2          |Co2 emissions rate|Q|E|
|Female-employ|Female employ rate|Q|E|
|Net-rate     |Internet users rate|Q|E|
|polity       |Democracy indicator score|Q|E|   
|relectricperperson| relectric per person|Q|E|

|Employ|Employment rate|Q|E|
|Urban|Urbanization rate|Q|E|     
|Life         |Life Expectancy|Q|R|

Type: C = Categorical, Q = Quantitative <br />
Kind: E = Explanatory, R = Response


### <a name = "elbow"></a>Average Distance From Observations

Data were randomly split into a training set that included 70% of the observations (N=84) and a test set that included 30% of the observations (N=36). A series of k-means cluster analyses were conducted on the training data specifying k=1-9 clusters, using Euclidean distance. The variance in the clustering variables that was accounted for by the clusters (r-square) was plotted for each of the nine cluster solutions in an elbow curve to provide guidance for choosing the number of clusters to interpret.

```python
# k-means cluster analysis for 1-9 clusters                                                           
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist
range_clusters=range(1,9)
meandist=[]

for k in range_clusters:
    model=KMeans(n_clusters=k)
    model.fit(clus_train)
    clusassign=model.predict(clus_train)
    meandist.append(sum(np.min(cdist(clus_train, model.cluster_centers_, 'euclidean'), axis=1))
    / clus_train.shape[0])

    plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))
    plt.plot(range_clusters, meandist)
    plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
    plt.ylabel('Average distance')
    plt.title('Selecting k with the Elbow Method')

    plt.show()

```

The elbow curve was inconclusive, suggesting that the 2, 3 and 5-cluster solutions might be interpreted. The results below are for an interpretation of the 3-cluster solution.


### <a name = "canocical"></a>First Two Canonica Variables

Canonical discriminant analyses was used to reduce the 12 clustering variable down a few variables that accounted for most of the variance in the clustering variables. A scatterplot of the first two canonical variables by cluster (Figure 2 shown below) indicated that the observations in clusters was generally distinct whith greater spread, suggesting higher within cluster variance.

### <a name = "anova"></a>Cluster Differences In GPA Using ANOVA

In order to externally validate the clusters, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducting to test for significant differences between the clusters on grade point average (GPA). A tukey test was used for post hoc comparisons between the clusters. Results indicated significant differences between the clusters on GPA. The tukey post hoc comparisons  indicating null hypothesys rejection on comparisons between groups 0,1; 0,4; 1,2; 1,4; 2,4; 3,4 and 4,5.

```python
gpa_data=data0['life']
# split GPA data into train and test sets
gpa_train, gpa_test = train_test_split(gpa_data, test_size=.3, random_state=123)
gpa_train1=pd.DataFrame(gpa_train)
gpa_train1.reset_index(level=0, inplace=True)
merged_train_all=pd.merge(gpa_train1, merged_train, on='index')
sub1 = merged_train_all[['life', 'cluster']].dropna()

import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import statsmodels.stats.multicomp as multi

gpamod = smf.ols(formula='life ~ C(cluster)', data=sub1).fit()
print (gpamod.summary())
