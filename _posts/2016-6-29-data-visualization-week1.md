On June 27, 2016, I enrolled in data management and visualization course via coursera (<https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization>). In this course, the assignments must be submitted on a blog entry, after some hours of research, I chose Medium for this task, mainly by the cleaning and focus sensation.

## Assignment 1: 
On this first assignment, the student has to choose one of five codebooks provided and two topics on it. This is my submission.

## My chosen dataset and topics: 
My choose was the portion of GapMinder, and Iâ€™m particularly interested in the topic: life expectancy x alcohol consumption x Gross Domestic Product per capita.

## My Codbook
